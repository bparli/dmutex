/*
Package quorums is a package for initializing and maintaining the distribted mutex's quorums from the local node's perspective.
It creates the quorums based on a binary tree of IP addresses (dependent on the dmutex/bintree package).
The package also exposes a function to calculate and return substitute paths for a failed node in the quorum.
